# Precision_recall_effort_query_formulation_model

This is the code repository for the PRE model - Precision-Recall-Effort query optimization framework. 

Description: Precision-Recall-Effort query framework is a query formulation and reformulation using Precision-Recall-Effort framework by maximizing the estimated recall and precision of the retrieval results and minimizing the effort for making the query.
